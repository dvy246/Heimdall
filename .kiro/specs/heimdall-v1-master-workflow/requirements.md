# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the implementation of Heimdall V1 Master Workflow - an enterprise-grade, three-module financial intelligence platform that rivals institutional research systems like Bloomberg Terminal and FactSet. This comprehensive system combines autonomous report generation, interactive data visualization, and intelligent conversational interfaces to create a complete financial analysis workspace.

**Three-Module Architecture:**

**Module 1: The Autonomous Reporter** - Core engine for deep-dive analysis that autonomously generates comprehensive intelligence reports through a sophisticated six-phase workflow.

**Module 2: The Interactive Intelligence Dashboard** - Rich visual interface with single-company and comparative analysis views for exploring financial health and performance.

**Module 3: The Intelligence Chatbot** - Conversational interface operating in Report Q&A mode (deep context-aware discussions) and Live Inquiry mode (real-time ad-hoc financial questions).

**Key Differentiators for Hiring Showcase:**
- **Modular Enterprise Architecture**: Demonstrates sophisticated system design with clear separation of concerns
- **Advanced Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Complex distributed AI systems with autonomous workflows
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Professional dashboards with comparative analysis capabilities
- **Conversational AI Integration**: Context-aware chatbot with multiple operational modes
- **Financial Domain Expertise**: Deep understanding of institutional finance workflows and compliance
- **Production-Ready Engineering**: Enterprise-grade error handling, monitoring, and scalability

The current implementation in `src/graph/workflow.py` provides a foundation but lacks the sophisticated three-module architecture that will position this as a world-class financial intelligence platform.
